# TicTacToe
A console-based TicTacToe game in Java featuring Human vs Human and Human vs AI gameplay using object-oriented programming.
This project contains two versions of the game:
  1.PlayersBased – Human vs Human
  2.AIBased – Human vs Computer (AI makes random moves)
Both versions share the same core game logic with separate classes for players, game board, and gameplay flow.
